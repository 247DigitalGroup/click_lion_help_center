            li
              p Do not apply any encryption or obfuscation technique to your content.
            li
              p We inspect element attributes (id, class, itemprop, etc.) to give a guess of their role on your entire page, so you should name them correctly in terms of their meaning. For example, we will ignore elements which seems to be irrelevant, such as recommendations, article suggestions, comments, advertisements, and so on. For that reason, it is not a good practice adding 
                code class="advert"
                |  to the article title, or adding 
                code class="entry-content"
                |  to your recommendations. In shorts, name your attributes exactly after what they do.

        .body
          ul
            li

                code h1
                |  tag. It would be even more ideal if it is the sole 
                code h1
                |  element on the page.
            li
              p If a tag name other than 
                code h1
                |  is used, you should improve its recognizability by adding meaningful attributes. Some good examples are: 
                code class="article-title"
                | , 
                code id="title"

            li
              p It is recommended to keep opengraph title and article title identical, unless you have very special reasons. We do not exactly use the opengraph title as final result, but its content is taken into account as well, so please make sure it is useful enough.

            li

                | , 
                code id="story-body"
                | .
            li
              p Irrelevant content inside the article body should be distinguished. For instance, you should never use p tags to write recommendations or suggestions. Also, it is easier for us to filter them out if you can add some descriptive classes to them, for example, 
                code class="related-articles"
                | , 
                code class="recommendations"
                |  or something like that.
            li
              p If your article consists of multiple sections, please keep the markup hierarchy of each section as simple as possible. Ideally, it should just include informative stuffs like 
                code p
                |  tags, linebreaks, images, links, etc. If their markup tree is too complicated with recommendations, suggestions, decorating blocks, there is a chance that our system cannot afford to merge all your sections correctly, or the extraction result contains junk texts.
