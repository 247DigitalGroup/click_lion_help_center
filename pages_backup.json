In this document, we recommend best practices that you should follow to ensure accurate content collection results.</p><article id=\"general-principles\"><h2 class=\"title\">General Principles</h2><div class=\"body\"><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Please do not use Javascript to generate your content.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Do not apply any encryption or obfuscation technique to your content.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We inspect element attributes (id, class, itemprop, etc.) to give a guess of their role on your entire page, so you should name them correctly in terms of their meaning. For example, we will ignore elements which seems to be irrelevant, such as recommendations, article suggestions, comments, advertisements, and so on. For that reason, it is not a good practice adding <code>class=\"advert\"</code> to the article title, or adding <code>class=\"entry-content\"</code> to your recommendations. In shorts, name your attributes exactly after what they do.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul></div></article><article id=\"title\"><h2 class=\"title\">Title</h2><div class=\"body\"><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The title of the article should be wrapped within a <code>h1</code> tag. It would be even more ideal if it is the sole <code>h1</code> element on the page.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If a tag name other than <code>h1</code> is used, you should improve its recognizability by adding meaningful attributes. Some good examples are: <code>class=\"article-title\"</code>, <code>id=\"title\"</code>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It is recommended to keep opengraph title and article title identical, unless you have very special reasons. We do not exactly use the opengraph title as final result, but its content is taken into account as well, so please make sure it is useful enough.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul></div></article><article id=\"content\"><h2 class=\"title\">Content</h2><div class=\"body\"><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Paragraphs should be wrapped within <code>p</code> tags.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The element which contains body text of the article should have self-explanatory attributes with it. Some of the good examples are: <code>class=\"article-content\"</code>, <code>id=\"story-body\"</code>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Irrelevant content inside the article body should be distinguished. For instance, you should never use p tags to write recommendations or suggestions. Also, it is easier for us to filter them out if you can add some descriptive classes to them, for example, <code>class=\"related-articles\"</code>, <code>class=\"recommendations\"</code> or something like that.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If your article consists of multiple sections, please keep the markup hierarchy of each section as simple as possible. Ideally, it should just include informative stuffs like <code>p</code> tags, linebreaks, images, links, etc. If their markup tree is too complicated with recommendations, suggestions, decorating blocks, there is a chance that our system cannot afford to merge all your sections correctly, or the extraction result contains junk texts.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul></div></article><article id=\"images\"><h2 class=\"title\">Images</h2><div class=\"body\"><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Please ensure that your article contains at least an image which meets the following requirements:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>minimum width: <code>320</code>, minimum height: <code>240</code></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>not a gif image</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>width/height ratio is in acceptable range: <code>320/240 x 0.5</code> &lt; <code>acceptable_ratio</code> &lt; <code>320/240 x 2.0</code></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Images should be embedded using simple <code>img</code> tags with <code>src</code> attributes.
